## Hi 🤓

I'm Daniele, a Game Programmer based in Turin, Italy.

I completed my Game Programming studies in a three-year academy program.

I primarily work with C#, C++, HLSL, CG, and GLSL, using Unity and Unreal Engine as my main game engines.
In the meantime, I keep improving the skills I already have and learning new ones.

Currently open for work as a Junior/Mid Game programmer or Software Engineer.
